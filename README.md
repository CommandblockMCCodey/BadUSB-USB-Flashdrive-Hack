# BadUSB-USB-Flashdrive-Hack

### **Don't use it to harm people**
It is open source and anyone can create repositories or use the code for their own projects.

You can also expand the project by inserting files such as _*.sh *.vbs *.bat_ scripts into the linux or windows folder, just note that windows only executes _*.bat_ and _*.vbs_ scripts and linux only _*.sh_ but **other scripts are not recognized**

__Happy hacking__




# The Virus Protection Problem

The problem with virus protection is that it will delete a few files, so I inserted an encrypted zip file into a folder called **recovery**. These are not scanned and remain undamaged. The password is **1234** and is also in that Folder **recovery** of file capture is **password.txt** in the _*.zip_ and _*.7z_ files is the same. When unpacking you have to enter the password and copy the files from the Linux zip into Linux and the Windows files into Windows. The directories for the scripts are located in the **scripts** folder, which is located in the directory where the start scripts and the recovery folder are located




# How To Use

To use my Bad USB repo, simply copy everything including the hidden files from **BadUSB** onto a USB stick.

To use the bad USB simply run **Toolbox.sh** in Linux or **Toolbox.cmd** in Windows. the console is very self-explanatory.

To use the functions of the bad USB simply enter the number of the hack script and press enter, the name of the script explains what it does
