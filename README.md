**Don't use it to harm people**
It is open source and anyone can create repositories or use the code for their own projects.

You can also expand the project by inserting files such as _*.sh *.vbs *.bat_ scripts into the linux or windows folder, just note that windows only executes _*.bat_ and _*.vbs_ scripts and linux only _*.sh_ but **other scripts are not recognized**

__Happy hacking__
