**Don't use it to harm people**
It is open source and anyone can create repositories or use the code for their own projects.

You can also expand the project by inserting files such as *.sh *.vbs *.bat scripts into the linux or windows folder, just note that windows only executes *.bat and *.vbs scripts and linux only *. sh but **other scripts are not recognized**

^Happy hacking^
