The problem with virus protection is that it will delete a few files, so I inserted an encrypted zip file into a folder called **recovery**. These are not scanned and remain undamaged. The password is **1234** and is also in that Folder **recovery** of file capture is **password.txt** in the _*.zip_ and _*.7z_ files is the same. When unpacking you have to enter the password and copy the files from the Linux zip into Linux and the Windows files into Windows. The directories for the scripts are located in the **scripts** folder, which is located in the directory where the start scripts and the recovery folder are located
